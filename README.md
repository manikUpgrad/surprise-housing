# Advanced Regression Analysis - Surprise Housing

Welcome to the Advanced Regression Analysis project for Surprise Housing. This repository is dedicated to understanding
the housing market dynamics in Australia, leveraging machine learning methodologies to predict house prices. Surprise
Housing, a US-based firm, intends to utilize this data-driven approach to identify undervalued properties and generate a
substantial return on investment.

## Project Overview

The crux of this project involves constructing a predictive model using Ridge and Lasso regression, regularisation
techniques that prevent overfitting and allow for better model performance. This model aims to determine the fair market
value of potential investment properties, enabling the company to make informed purchasing decisions.

Key questions this analysis seeks to answer:

- What are the significant variables that influence the price of a house?
- How well do these variables explain the variation in house prices?
- What are the optimal values of lambda for Ridge and Lasso regression?

These insights will play a crucial role in guiding the company's strategy. By understanding how prices fluctuate with
different variables, the firm can concentrate its efforts on areas that promise high returns, providing a solid entry
point into a new market.
